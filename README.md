# rustvision
**rustvision** is a lightweight, pure-Rust implementation of a simple feedforward **neural network** for classifying handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset.

Itâ€™s inspired by the original C implementation by **Tsoding**, and rewritten with an idiomatic Rust architecture for clarity, safety, and extensibility.
